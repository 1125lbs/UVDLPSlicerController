This is the 3dDLPUVController project, also known as CreationWorkshop

This software allows you to create cross-sectional image slices of 3d Binary STL models. 
It also allows you to generate GCode to control a variety of 3d DLP UV printers via serial interfaces.
I used C# to code this project along with Visual Studio 2010

 New functionality will also allow you to control powder-bed based printers through a standard print interface,
as well as Fused Filament Fabrication machines.
