     This class generates support structures for the scene.
     * I'm going to start off by doing the following:
     * walk from the min/max x/y in 1mm resolution in 3d
     * generate a ray from the z=0 to the zMax build size and test the scene for intersection,
     * at intersection points, we can generate cylinders
     * 
     * This first implementation is a simple x/y scan,
     * further implementations can use more than a cylinder object, or 
     * modify the class to generate new sements on demand
     * We could use the concept of a slice to represent a plane of points
     * this plane of points can then be extruded along a path,
     * able to add or remove new segments.
     * We can use this for many porposes
     * for now, it has to be fairly convex, or generating a center point for
     * surface triangulation may not always work.
     * we can use circle/shape funtions to generate segments/slices
