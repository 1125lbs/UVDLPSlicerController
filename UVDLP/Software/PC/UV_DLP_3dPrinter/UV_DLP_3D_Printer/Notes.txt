Hardware objectives:
Use as much standard 3d printing hardware as possible.
A Ramps / Gen4 board or compatible should be using to control the Z Axis of the device

Ultimately, I want my application to be a replacement for apps such as replicatorG, printerface,etc...

I need to be able to syncronize the GCode Zmovements with the display of the slices on the secondary monitor
How can I do this?
	1) one possible method -
	The GCode file must be generated to contain special comments between z movements
	The comments can trigger the display of a slice
		cons - can only be built from host computer - not run from machine - this shouldn't be much of an issue, because
		the image slices need to be sent from the machine anyway	
	2) The z axis and slices are syncronized by time only
		cons - this could quickly get out of sync, problems with pause

GCode Generation:
	use a start.gcode file
	use an end.gcode file
	use a layer.gcode file for in between layers
